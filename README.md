## This is a technical task for vacantion 
<p>
In 2017, engineers at Mocoding Ukraine were working on an innovative project called <a href="https://warmcoast.com/">Warmcoast</a>. One of the key features of the project was the ability to display sea surface temperature directly on the beach. To achieve this goal, Mocoding LLC partnered with <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/">NASA Earth Data</a>NASA Earth Data to access their daily dataset of sea surface temperatures and integrate them into Mocoding's proprietary beach database. The daily dataset was approximately 3 gigabytes in size, and as part of the processing step, it was converted to a much smaller two-dimensional byte array, with each item containing the sea surface temperature in â„‰ at a specific latitude and longitude.

To demonstrate the functionality of the system and provide the marketing team with high-quality visual materials, one of the team members developed an algorithm to generate heat maps of sea surface temperatures.

Task
As a software engineer at Mocoding, you will be presented with a wide range of challenging tasks that will keep you engaged and help your professional growth. And that is one of such tasks. You are required to create the following:

Given a binary file and an empty world map, render a heat map of global sea surface temperatures, similar to the image above.
Create a demonstrational website that enables users to upload the binary file and display the resulting image.
Technical requirements:
Project should be hosted on your GitHub account and be open to public
Use only Typescript that transpile code to ES6+
Use Node 18 and PNPM as a package manager
Use React for the website
Use workspaces - create separate packages for website and image creation component
Use mocha and chai for unit tests
Empty world map image is considered constant and can be included as part of the packages
Binary file is not considered constant and is provided only as an example
Expectations
The goal for this task is not to produce a production ready code but to assess candidate's ability of writing one. When working on this task please pay close attention to the following:

Consistent coding style
Correct usage of tools and frameworks
Exceptions handling
Unit tests
Hints:
We recognize that this task may require a significant investment of time, particularly for less experienced engineers. Therefore, we have included several helpful tips to assist you in completing this challenge.

Unbuild can help you quickly get started with a library creation.
Vite can help you quickly get started with a website creation.
Binary file has the following dimensions:
</p>
<p>
const BINARY_DIMENSION_X = 36000;
</p>
<p>
const DIMENSION_Y = 17999;

## My review
<p>
I was unable to complete the task and got stuck at the stage of processing the uploaded binary file. My knowledge of Node.js is not sufficient at the moment to solve this problem.
</p>

## My conclusions

<p>
To solve a technical task of this level, you need to have better knowledge in Node.js and TypeScript. I will continue to work on solving this problem as soon as I get the hang of TypeScript.
